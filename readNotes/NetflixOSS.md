## Big Data

> Tools and services to get the most out of your (big) data

- Data is invaluable in making Netflix such an exceptional service for our customers. Behind the scenes, we have a rich ecosystem of (big) data technologies facilitating our algorithms and analytics. We use and contribute to broadly-adopted open source technologies including Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Parquet, Presto, and Spark. In addition, weâ€™ve developed and contributed some additional tools and services, which have further elevated our data platform. [Genie](https://github.com/Netflix/genie) is a powerful, REST-based abstraction to our various data processing frameworks, notably Hadoop. Inviso provides detailed insights into the performance of our Hadoop jobs and clusters. Lipstick shows the workflow of Pig jobs in a clear, visual fashion. And Aegisthus enables the bulk abstraction of data out of Cassandra for downstream analytic processing.
